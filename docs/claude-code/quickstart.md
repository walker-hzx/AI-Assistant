##
[​

](#before-you-begin)
Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A terminal or command prompt open

If you’ve never used the terminal before, check out the [terminal guide](/docs/en/terminal-guide)

- A code project to work with

- A [Claude subscription](https://claude.com/pricing) (Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise), [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) account, or access through a [supported cloud provider](/docs/en/third-party-integrations)

This guide covers the terminal CLI. Claude Code is also available on the [web](https://claude.ai/code), as a [desktop app](/docs/en/desktop), in [VS Code](/docs/en/vs-code) and [JetBrains IDEs](/docs/en/jetbrains), in [Slack](/docs/en/slack), and in CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](/docs/en/github-actions) and [GitLab](/docs/en/gitlab-ci-cd). See [all interfaces](/docs/en/overview#use-claude-code-everywhere).

](#step-1-install-claude-code)
Step 1: Install Claude Code

To install Claude Code, use one of the following methods:

-
Native Install (Recommended)

-
Homebrew

-
WinGet

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
`

**Windows PowerShell:**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
`

**Windows CMD:**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
`

**Windows requires [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).** Install it first if you don’t have it.

Native installations automatically update in the background to keep you on the latest version.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`brew install --cask claude-code
`

Homebrew installations do not auto-update. Run `brew upgrade claude-code` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
`

WinGet installations do not auto-update. Run `winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode` periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.

](#step-2-log-in-to-your-account)
Step 2: Log in to your account

Claude Code requires an account to use. When you start an interactive session with the `claude` command, you’ll need to log in:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`claude
# You'll be prompted to log in on first use
`

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`/login
# Follow the prompts to log in with your account
`

You can log in using any of these account types:

- [Claude Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise](https://claude.com/pricing) (recommended)

- [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) (API access with pre-paid credits). On first login, a “Claude Code” workspace is automatically created in the Console for centralized cost tracking.

- [Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/third-party-integrations) (enterprise cloud providers)

Once logged in, your credentials are stored and you won’t need to log in again. To switch accounts later, use the `/login` command.
##
[​

](#step-3-start-your-first-session)
Step 3: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`cd /path/to/your/project
claude
`

You’ll see the Claude Code welcome screen with your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates. Type `/help` for available commands or `/resume` to continue a previous conversation.

After logging in (Step 2), your credentials are stored on your system. Learn more in [Credential Management](/docs/en/authentication#credential-management).

##
[​

](#step-4-ask-your-first-question)
Step 4: Ask your first question

Let’s start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`what does this project do?
`

Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`what technologies does this project use?
`

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`where is the main entry point?
`

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`explain the folder structure
`

You can also ask Claude about its own capabilities:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`what can Claude Code do?
`

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`how do I create custom skills in Claude Code?
`

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`can Claude Code work with Docker?
`

Claude Code reads your files as needed - you don’t have to manually add context. Claude also has access to its own documentation and can answer questions about its features and capabilities.

##
[​

](#step-5-make-your-first-code-change)
Step 5: Make your first code change

Now let’s make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`add a hello world function to the main file
`

Claude Code will:

- Find the appropriate file

- Show you the proposed changes

- Ask for your approval

- Make the edit

Claude Code always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable “Accept all” mode for a session.

##
[​

](#step-6-use-git-with-claude-code)
Step 6: Use Git with Claude Code

Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`what files have I changed?
`

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`commit my changes with a descriptive message
`

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`create a new branch called feature/quickstart
`

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`show me the last 5 commits
`

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`help me resolve merge conflicts
`

##
[​

](#step-7-fix-a-bug-or-add-a-feature)
Step 7: Fix a bug or add a feature

Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.
Describe what you want in natural language:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`add input validation to the user registration form
`

Or fix existing issues:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
`

Claude Code will:

- Locate the relevant code

- Understand the context

- Implement a solution

- Run tests if available

##
[​

](#step-8-test-out-other-common-workflows)
Step 8: Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with Claude:
**Refactor code**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
`

**Write tests**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`write unit tests for the calculator functions
`

**Update documentation**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`update the README with installation instructions
`

**Code review**

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`review my changes and suggest improvements
`

**Remember**: Claude Code is your AI pair programmer. Talk to it like you would a helpful colleague - describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.

Pro tips for beginners

For more, see [best practices](/docs/en/best-practices) and [common workflows](/docs/en/common-workflows).

Be specific with your requests

Instead of: “fix the bug”Try: “fix the login bug where users see a blank screen after entering wrong credentials”

Use step-by-step instructions

Break complex tasks into steps:

Report incorrect code

Copy

Ask AI

`1. create a new database table for user profiles
2. create an API endpoint to get and update user profiles
3. build a webpage that allows users to see and edit their information
`

Let Claude explore first

Before making changes, let Claude understand your code:

Report incorrect code
